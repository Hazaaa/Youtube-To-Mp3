# YouTube To Mp3
"YouTube To Mp3" is desktop application for converting 'YouTube' and 'YouTube Music' videos to Mp3 developed in .Net 6 and Winforms.

**NOTICE:** This is just me working and experimenting with .Net 6 and different libraries. This app will not be used for anything else except leveling up my coding skills and increasing my knowledge of .Net Core.

## Requirements
 - This app is developed in .Net 6 so to run it you will need [.Net 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).  
 - For converting this app is using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) so you will have to download it and place just ffmpeg.exe and place it inside of Resources folder of the app.
